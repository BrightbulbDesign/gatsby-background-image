            Hi there!
            As @timhagn momentarily is the main contributor to this package, this issue
            has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
            any recent activity.
            It will be closed if no further activity occurs, though we're open to
            suggestions on how to get more maintainers!
            Thank you for your contributions : )!
          CLOSE_MESSAGE: |
